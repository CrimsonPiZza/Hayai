        "Puzzles move onto the next level with ‘Super Puzzle Dream’, a mix between classic jigsaw and a ‘Tetris’-style dynamic mechanic. #Pinocchio is the hashtag for a classic tale that teaches children what happens when they are disobedient and tell lies. Pinocchio will learn to obey, to be responsible, not to trust strangers and to appreciate school, but most importantly: it teaches us the importance of telling the truth. All this is told accompanied by beautiful drawings. Two levels of play, 'senior' (for adults) and 'junior' (for children aged 3+), guarantee hours of entertainment for all. Become an expert and finish the puzzles in the shortest possible time and you will find yourself amongst the best in the world on the online leaderboard. You can also play with friends and family in the one-on-one split-screen competition mode. Your rival won't make it easy for you! Don't give up - fill an energy bar to perform a counterattack and put them in their place. Or have fun working together to complete the puzzles in Cooperative (co-op) mode.",
